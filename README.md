# Loan Fraud Prediction: A Python Data Science Tutorial

## Project Overview

This project is a tutorial designed to demonstrate a typical data science workflow, using Python for loan fraud prediction. Initially created in 2020, the project was revisited and updated in 2023 to improve the code quality and incorporate some of the latest best practices in data science.

## Project Structure

The project follows the standard structure recommended by Google's ProjectTemplate, making it easy to understand and navigate. It consists of the following main directories:
- `data`: Contains the raw data for this project.
- `src`: Contains source code for use in this project.

The `src` directory further includes the following subdirectories:
- `models`: Scripts to train models and then use trained models to make predictions.
- `visualization`: Scripts to create exploratory and results-oriented visualizations.


This project serves as a tutorial and should be used for educational purposes. It provides a basic understanding of the steps involved in a data science project, from data collection to model evaluation. While it provides a solid foundation, real-world projects often involve more complexity and additional steps.
